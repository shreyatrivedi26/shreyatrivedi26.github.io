**Hi class, welcome to the AOS C111/204 final project!** <img align="right" width="220" height="220" src="/assets/IMG/template_logo.png">

For this project, you will be applying your skills to train a machine learning model using real-world data, then publishing a report on your own website.

* To get data for your project, you could:
  * use **your own data** from a separate research activity
  * **scour the internet** to find something original, then preprocess it yourself - see the Module Overview on BruinLearn for some resources
  * browse an archive of data designed for machine learning problems, such as the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets)

* Your report should be in the region of 2000-2500 words with three to four figures, and written in a scientific language and style. [This template page](/project.md) gives an example structure that you could use, but feel free to make it your own.

Your website will be a great addition to your CV, and a place to host future projects too since it doubles as a GitHub repository. The first step is to set up a project website like this one by following the instructions below. 

## How does this website work?

First, check out the Github repository for this site: [https://github.com/atmosalex/atmosalex.github.io/](https://github.com/atmosalex/atmosalex.github.io/).

Using GitHub pages, you can write a website using markdown syntax - the same syntax we use to write comments in Google Colab notebooks. GitHub pages then takes the markdown file and renders it as a web page using a Jekyll theme. The markdown source code for this page [is shown here](https://github.com/atmosalex/atmosalex.github.io/blob/main/README.md?plain=1).

## Setting up your Project Website

### How to copy this site as a template
1. Create [a GitHub account](https://github.com/)
2.	Create a new GitHub repository with the name **username.github.io**, where **username** is your GitHub username as shown below. Select *public* and do not tick *Add a README file*. [![screenshot][1]][1]
3.	From your new repository, you should see a *Quick setup* guide. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click *Import code*, as shown: [![screenshot][2]][2]
4.	In the box that says *Your old repository’s clone URL*, copy and paste this URL: `https://github.com/atmosalex/atmosalex.github.io/`, then proceed.
5.	Go to the *Settings* tab, then click *Pages* (under *Code and automation*), and check that the *Build and deployment* section looks like this: [![screenshot][3]][3]
6.	If you can see the *Actions* tab, click it and check that the build and deployment action has finished. Once it has, navigate to **[username].github.io** to see your site, which should be a copy of this one! If you cannot see an *Actions* tab, just wait a few minutes then go to your URL to check it is live.

Now you are ready to customize your site! To add your name to the site, go to your Github page, edit `_config.yml`, and replace the temporary title with your name.

[2]: /assets/IMG/instr_import.png
[3]: /assets/IMG/instr_bd.png

### How to change the theme (optional)
1.	You can choose any theme [listed on this page](https://pages.github.com/themes/), though some do not work as well on mobile devices.
2.	From GitHub, edit `_config.yml` and replace the `theme:` line with `theme: jekyll-theme-name` where `name` is the name of the theme from the above list. **For the `minima` theme, use a shortened preface like so `theme: minima`**, the others seem to need the whole preface `theme: jekyll-theme-`. You can check the *Actions* tab (as in step 6. above) to make sure the site is building successfully.

### How to change your site logo (optional)
1. Some themes, such as `jekyll-theme-minimal`, show a logo. In your repository, upload a logo or profile picture to the `assets/IMG/` directory
2. Open `_config.yml` and modify the line `logo: /assets/IMG/template_logo.png` to point to your new image

## Guide to Adding Content
* Your repository's `README.md` file (the file you are reading now) acts like a home page. Replace its contents with whatever you want the world to see by editing the file on GitHub.
* If you want to turn this page into a CV or blog, etc., it may be useful to refer to a [guide for writing Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
* You can create other markdown files (.md) in your repository and navigate to them from this page using links, i.e.: [here is a link to another file, `project.md`](project.md)
* When editing a markdown file on GitHub, it is useful to wrap text by selecting the *Soft wrap* option as shown: ![screenshot](/assets/IMG/instr_wrap.png)
* If you want to get even more technical, you can also write HTML in your .md files, and GitHub Pages will render it. For example, the image below is displayed by writing the following (edit this file to see!): `<img align="right" width="200" height="200" src="/assets/IMG/template_frog.png">`
<img align="right" width="337" height="200" src="/assets/IMG/template_frog.png">

## Delivering your Project

Your final project has three components: a dataset, a report, and your code.

### Dataset

A link to the dataset you used must be submitted on BruinLearn so that your course instructor can use it to run your code. To do this, it might be easiest to upload the dataset to Google Drive, then share a link (click *Share* then *Copy link*). If your dataset is too big to upload, try to find a way to reduce its size, or speak with your instructor if this is not possible.

### Report

Your report should be **delivered via your website**. Submit a link to your website on BruinLearn so that your instructor can browse it to find your report. 

To make this simple, you can write the report using a word processor or Latex, then export it as a .pdf file and upload it to the `assets` directory. You can then link to it [like so](/assets/project_demo.pdf). However, you can also type the report directly onto the website using another markdown page - [here is](/project.md) a template for that.

### Code

A link to your code must be submitted on BruinLearn, and the course instructor must be able to download and run your code using the dataset. The code could be in a Google Colab notebook (make sure to *share* the notebook so access is set to **Anyone with the link**), or you could upload the code into a separate GitHub repository, or you could upload the code into the `assets` directory of your website and link to it.

## Final Project

### Title: Understanding relationships between Antarctic sea-ice thickness and the southern hemispheric atmospheric circulations

#### Introduction 
Sea-ice distribution in Antarctica is subject to diverse atmospheric and oceanic processes, contributing to non-uniform expansion across the region. Regional disparities are evident, with the Ross Sea experiencing positive (expanding) sea-ice anomalies, while the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea witnesses negative (retreating) anomalies (Lefebvre & Goosse, 2008; Matear et al., 2015; Raphael et al., 2016; Zwally et al., 2002). The causative factors for such patterns remain unclear, with proposed influences including atmospheric temperature and wind stress changes (Lefebvre & Goosse, 2005, 2008; Liu et al., 2004) and atmospheric feedback mechanisms (Stammerjohn et al., 2012; Stammerjohn et al., 2008).
This study focuses on Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation patterns and their role in explaining interannual variability in Southern Ocean sea-ice trends, with a specific emphasis on Sea-Ice Thickness (SIT). The project aims to elucidate the relationships between Antarctic SIT and five primary large-scale atmospheric circulation indices in the Southern Hemisphere: Southern Annular Mode (SAM), Amundsen Sea Low (ASL), El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Meridional Wind Index (MWI), and Zonal Wave-3 Index (ZW3). While these indices are recognized as primary drivers of Antarctic sea-ice changes, their influence varies regionally, and no singular mode has been identified as the predominant factor governing total sea-ice changes in Antarctica. In addition to regional heterogeneity, seasonal variabilities in sea-ice are influenced by atmospheric models. Given the non-linear relationships between sea-ice and atmospheric variables, this study employs supervised Random Forest Regression, a machine learning algorithm, to comprehend and predict these intricate relationships. 

The objectives of this study include:
I.	Understanding the Significance of Climatic Modes:
a.	Identifying the primary dictating factor for sea-ice distribution in each region.
b.	Assessing the magnitude and direction of the impact.

II.	Assessing effectiveness of selected Machine Learning Algorithm: 
a.	Evaluating the efficacy of supervised machine learning algorithm, specifically Random Forest Regression, in capturing spatio-temporal relationships.
b.	Investigating the seasonal variations in the performance of regional specific-trained Random Forest Regression models.
